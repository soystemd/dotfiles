# with this script, you can remap a key or key combination, to
# different keys in different programs.

# for example, you can have ctrl+shift+j be ctrl+Page_Up
# in firefox, right-arrow in coolreader3, and unaffected (ctrl+shift+j)
# in all other programs, by simply binding this command to ctrl+shift+j
# in a hotkey program of your choice (something like sxhkd):
#   $  inject ctrl+shift+j firefox ctrl+Page_Up cr3 Right

# you can find the correct name of keys here:
# https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/x11proto/plain/keysymdef.h

# first argument is the key that will be sent if current active
# window is none of the given programs, second is the program
# you want to send another key to, and third is the key you want
# to send. you can add more program-key pairs as fourth and fifth
# arguments, sixth and seventh, and so on, as many as you want.

# an example sxhkd entry maps ctrl-c to ctrl-p in firefox,
# and alt-t in chrome. if the current active program is neither,
# this program sends the original key (ctrl-c).

# Example sxhkd entry:
# ctrl + c
#	inject ctrl+c firefox ctrl+p chrome alt+t
